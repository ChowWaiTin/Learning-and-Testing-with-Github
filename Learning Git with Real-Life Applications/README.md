# Learning Git with Real-Life Applications

## Context of Real-Life Application
A group of developers decided to go on vacation trip together after their recent project has been deployed and commisioned. The lead developer of the developement team decided to use GitHub to store the details of their vacation trip such as the itenary, budget planning and etc.

## 1. Setting up the Pre-requisites
Before the team of developers can plan for their trip, the lead developer would need to ensure that the team would have the following things required:

- Having [Git Installed](./1.%20Setting%20up%20the%20Pre-requisites/Git%20Bash%20(Windows)%20Tutorial.mkv) on their Local Device
- Having a [GitHub Account](./1.%20Setting%20up%20the%20Pre-requisites/VS%20Code%20(Windows)%20Tutorial.mkv)

## 2. Getting Started - Initialise a Repository for the Project (Create a Shared Folder for Collaboration)

Before the gathering the team together to plan for the trip, the lead developer would need to create a **central shared folder** where the team can collaborate together to plan for the trip. In GitHub, this shared folder is a **central repository** that the developers will be collaborating in.

To have a central repository for collaboration, the lead developer would need to initalise a repository for the team to plan the trip.

To do so, the lead developer would need to:

1. [Configure Global Setting for Git](./2.%20Getting%20Started/1._Git_Configure_Global_Settings.md)

    *  This is to allow you to set default values for your user identity and preferred behaviors across all Git repositories on your development machine. 

2. [Initialise (Create) A Remote Repository on GitHub Webpage](./2.%20Getting%20Started/2._Create_Remote_Repo.md)

    * This is to allow the team to store the information of their trip on the remotely

3. [Adding Collaborators](./2.%20Getting%20Started/3._Add_Collaborators.md)

    * This is to allow the team to be able to collaborate and plan together for the trip

4. [Initialise (Create) A Local Git Repository on Local Device](./2.%20Getting%20Started/4._Create_Local_Repo.md)

    * This repository (file folder) will contain all the files and folders associated with the planning of the vacation trip.

5. [Making Initial Commits (Initialise Initial Files) for Local Git Repository](./2.%20Getting%20Started/5._Initial_Files_Local_Repo.md)

    * Add Initial Files to Local Git Repository
    * Commit the Changes to Local Git Repository

6. [Connect Local Git Repository to Global Git Repository](./2.%20Getting%20Started/6._Remote_to_Local_Repo.md)

7. [Push Changes to Global Git Repository](./2.%20Getting%20Started/7._Push_Global_Repository.md)

## 3. Getting Started - Begin Collaborating (Cloning Global Repository to Local Device)
To begin collaborating to plan the trip together, the developers can start by cloning the global repository into their local device.
