## Storyline 2 (Xun)
1. Developer A edits text file `itinerary.txt` for Day 1 itinerary. While planning the schedule,
he has difficulty choosing between one of the two places.
2. Developer B decides to help, so he checkout Developer A's branch.
    a. Firstly he typed out `git branch --all` to list out the branches that have been created on the repository.
    b. Once he knows Developer A's branch to checkout, he typed out `git switch {Developer's A branch name} or git checkout {Developer's A branch name}`.
3. Both of them ended up working in the same branch, on the same file.
4. Developer B finished editing the file and pushes the edit.
    a. Firstly he needs to `git pull` on the branch itself.
    b. Next he can stage his changes and commit it with `git add .` .
    c. Then followed by `git commit -m "insert commit message" `.
    d. After that he `git push` his changes to the branch.
5. At the same time, Developer A also made some changes to the file and tries to push the edit.    
    a. He stage his changes and commit it with `git add .` .
    b. Then followed by `git commit -m "insert commit message" `.
    c. After that he `git push` his changes to the branch.
6. Conflict happened for Developer A since he is pushing his changes later.    
7. In the process of resolving the conflict, he has to ensure that Developer B's work does not overwrite his own work and vice versa.
    a. In this scenario, he has to carefully look through line by line at both Incoming Changes and Current Changes.
    b. Then decide what changes to accept and merge accordingly.
8. Upon resolving the conflict, Developer A performed a commit and pushed the changes to his own remote branch. 
9. Finally, he can merge his branch to the main branch so Developer B can see his changes he made to the itinerary.
