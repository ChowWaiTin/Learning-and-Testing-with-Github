## Storyline 2 (Xun)
1. Developer A edits text file `day1_itinerary.txt` for Day 1 itinerary. While planning the schedule, he has difficulty choosing between one of the two places.

2. Developer B decides to help, so he checkout Developer A's branch.

    a. Firstly, he list out the branches that have been created on the repository with
    ```
    git branch --all
    ```

    b. Once he knows which branch Developer A is on, he uses either one of the following commands below to switch his current working branch to the same branch that Developer A is working on.
    ```
    git switch {Developer's A branch name} 
    ```
    ```
    git checkout {Developer's A branch name}
    ```
    
3. Both of them ended up working in the same branch, on the same file.

4. Developer B began to work on the file. After finishing, he commit the changes  and pushes the edit.

    a. Firstly, he needs to pull the updates(if any) from the remote repository into his current working branch. This is to ensure that he gets the latest updates to the files in his branch locally. (In the event someone makes a commit and push into the remote branch)
    ```
    git pull
    ```

    b. Next he can stage his changes and commit it after he is done with his work.
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Updated day 1 itinerary"
    ```    
    c. Lastly, he pushes his changes to the remote branch.
    ```
    git push
    ```
5. At the same time, Developer A made some changes to the file and tries to push the edit, not knowing Developer B had already made some changes.
    He stage his changes and commit it with 
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Helped Developer B with day 1 itinerary"
    git push
    ```    
6. Conflict happened for Developer A since he is pushing his changes later.    

7. In the process of resolving the conflict, he has to ensure that Developer B's work does not overwrite his own work and vice versa.

    a. In this scenario, he has to carefully look through line by line at both Incoming Changes and Current Changes.

    b. Then decide what changes to accept and merge accordingly.

8. Upon resolving the conflict, Developer A performed a commit and pushed the changes to his own remote branch. 

9. Finally, he can merge his branch to the main branch so Developer B can see his changes he made to the itinerary.
