# Merging Different Branches

## Pre-requisite
1. Complete the previous tasks.
2. Check that the files **day3.itinerary.txt** has been created in the initial file setup.

## Objective
1. Learn of possible merge conflict from merging different branches.
2. Handling of merge conflict
3. Understanding the different ways to handle merge conflict


## Storyline 4 (Bao Jin)
1. Developer A and B decided to begin planning for their food on day 3 in **day3_itinerary.txt** by listing the different food outlets available. They decided that they did not want to mix their food planning with their literary planning. 

2. Developer A decided to create another branch from the `itinerary/activities` branch.

    **Developer A switch to `itinerary/activities` and pull changes**
    - Check the current branch location with `git branch`
        ```
        git branch
        ```
        The command displays the **local branches** in the **local repository**. The branch name with the asterisk(*) is the current branch location.

        ![git branch main](../images/command_4_git_branch_2branch_master.png)

    - If the current branch is not `itinerary/activities`, switch to main branch with `git switch <branch>`
        ```
        git switch itinerary/activities
        ```
        If branch switch is successful, the prompt `switched to branch` will appear. 
        ![git branch main](../images/command_4_switch_branch_2branch_itinerary.png)

        To confirm the current branch, repeat the `git branch` command. The asterisk(*) should be beside the `itinerary/activities` branch.
        ![git branch main](../images/command_4_git_branch_2branch_itinerary.png)

    - Ensure `itinerary/activities` branch is updated with `git pull origin`
        ```
        git fetch origin
        git pull origin
        ```

    **Developer A creates a new branch**
    - Create a new branch and navigate to the branch "`itinerary/food`"
        ```
        git checkout -b itinerary/food
        ```
        The `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>` command can be thought of as a combination of `git branch <new_branch_name>` and `git switch <new_branch_name>`.

    - Check the current branch location with `git branch`
        ```
        git branch
        ```
    - Publish branch in the remote repository in order to share with other developers. This will create a new remote branch.
        ```
        git push -u origin food/locations
        ```

2. Developer B decided to work independently from Developer A. In order to achieve this, he decided to create another branch out of the itinerary/activities branch.

    **Developer B switch to `itinerary/activities` and pull changes**
    - Developer B checks the branches with `git branch -a`.
        ```
        git branch -a
        ```

        Check that the current local branch is "`itinerary/activities`" branch. The asterisk(*) indicates the branch.
        
        ![git branch itinerary](../images/4_3/4_3_git_branch_all_itinerary_branch.png)

    - If current branch is at "`master`", switch to the "`itinerary/activities`" branch
        ```
        git switch itinerary/activities
        ```
        If switching from another branch:
        ![git branch master switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_switch_master_to_itinerary.png)
        
        If already on current branch:
        ![git branch itinerary switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_switch_itinerary_to_itinerary.png)

    - Developer B updates the branch using `git pull`
        ```
        git pull
        ```

    **Developer B creates a new branch**
    - Developer B creates a new branch and switch to it `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
        ```
        git checkout -b itinerary/delicacy
        ```
    - Publish branch to remote repository with `git push -u origin <new_remote_branch_name>`
        ```
        git push -u origin itinerary/delicacy
        ```

3. Developer B obtained a list of food outlets using the internet. After searching for the required information, he decided to update the **day3_itinerary.txt** file.

    - Developer B update the file **day3_itinerary.txt** to include the food plan.
        ```
        Day 3: Hakone
        ** Have breakfast before proceeding
        Morning: Take the train from Kyoto to Hakone
            > A scenic area known for its hot springs and stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        Afternoon: Take a relaxing soak in one of the many hot springs (onsen) in the area.
            > Hakone is also known for its open-air museums, such as the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the Pola Museum of Art.
        Evening: Take a boat ride on Lake Ashi and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Fuji.
                
        # Food Plan
        Morning:
            > LOCATION: Gion Tokuya
        Afternoon:
            > LOCATION: Hakone Soba Okamotoya
        Evening:
            > LOCATION: TBD
        ```

4. After adding his update, Developer B decided to stage his changes, make a commit and push his changes to his remote branch `itinerary/delicacy`.

    - Stage change with `git add .`
        ```
        git add .
        ```
    - Commit changes with `git commit -m <commit_message>`
        ```
        git commit -m "Added places to eat on day 3"
        ```
    - Update remote repository with `git push origin`
        ```ps1
        # Check for updates
        git pull origin
        # Push his changes
        git push origin
        ```

5. While Developer B was creating a list of food outlets, Developer A was also working on a similar task. However, he chose to research the list through guide books and other source. Upon completion of his research, he decided to update the **day3_itinerary.txt** file in his `itinerary/food` branch.

    - Developer A update the file: **day3_itinerary.txt**
        ```
        Day 3: Hakone
        Morning: Take the train from Kyoto to Hakone
        ** Have breakfast after train ride
            > A scenic area known for its hot springs and stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        Afternoon: Take a relaxing soak in one of the many hot springs (onsen) in the area.
            > Hakone is also known for its open-air museums, such as the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the Pola Museum of Art.
        Evening: Take a boat ride on Lake Ashi and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Fuji.
                
        # Food Plan
        Breakfast:
            > LOCATION: Tenzan
        Lunch:
            > LOCATION: Kaiseki Kotone
        Dinner:
            > LOCATION: Hakone Soba Okamotoya
        ```

6. Upon completion of his task, Developer A decided to stage his changes, make a commit. He subsequently pushed his changes to the `itinerary/food` branch

    - Stage change with `git add .`
        ```
        git add .
        ```
    - Commit changes with `git commit -m <commit_message>`
        ```
        git commit -m "Added a list of food outlet for day 3"
        ```
    - Update remote repository with `git push origin`
        ```ps1
        # Check for updates
        git pull origin
        # Push his changes
        git push origin
        ```

7. After having updated the remote repository with his list, Developer A saw a message from Developer B indicating that the latter has updated a list of his own in a separate branch. He decided to consolidate the information in order to create a complete list.


8. Developer A begins by finding and navigating to the branch created by Developer B to see the changes.
    - Pull any updates from remote branch
        ```
        git pull
        ```

    - Find the remote branch `itinerary/delicacy` created by Developer B
        ```
        git branch -a
        ```
    - Switch to remote branch `itinerary/delicacy`
        ```
        git switch itinerary/delicacy
        ```

9. Developer A subsequently decides to merge Developer B's branch to his own. 
    - Switch to his `itinerary/food` branch
        ```
        git switch itinerary/food
        ```
    - Merge the "`itinerary/delicacy`" into the current branch "`itinerary/food`"
        ```
        git merge itinerary/delicacy
        ```

8. Upon merging, Developer A encountered conflict as they had updated the same file. He proceed to begin the conflict resolution 
    - Open **Visual Studio Code**

    - Open the source control to see the conflict


9. When resolving the conflict, Developer A found that there are merits in both his and Developer B's idea. He proceeded to adopt some changes from both sides.

    - Perform manual changes to include info from both sides

    ```
        Day 3: Hakone
        ** Have breakfast before proceeding
        Morning: Take the train from Kyoto to Hakone
            > A scenic area known for its hot springs and stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        Afternoon: Take a relaxing soak in one of the many hot springs (onsen) in the area.
            > Hakone is also known for its open-air museums, such as the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the Pola Museum of Art.
        Evening: Take a boat ride on Lake Ashi and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Fuji.
                
        # Food Plan
        Breakfast:
            > LOCATION: Gion Tokuya
        Lunch:
            > LOCATION: Hakone Soba Okamotoya
        Dinner:
            > LOCATION: Kaiseki Kotone
        ```

10. After resolving all the changes, Developer A created a commit to finalize the merge. The result of the merge is in food/location branch.
