## Storyline 1 (Xun) 
1. Developer A is tasked to come up with the itinerary for day 1.

    a. Firstly, he creates a branch name "`itinerary/activities`" with 
    ```
    git branch itinerary/activities.
    ```
2. Followed by switching to the branch he created. 
    ```
    git switch itinerary/activities
    ```
3. He started to edit the text file named `day1_itenerary.txt` and saved the file locally.

4. So in order to share the changes with the group, he has to "push" the updates into the remote repository. After he is done with editing of the text file, he staged, commit and push the files with the following:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "added itinerary text file"
    git push
    ```
5. Lastly, he merge his branch to the main branch by checking for any changes in the main branch.
    ```
    git switch main    
    git pull
    git switch itinerary/activities
    git merge main
    git switch main
    git merge itinerary/activities
    git push
    ```
    Switch back to his own branch and publish the branch along with his changes to the "`itinerary/activities`" remote repository.
    ```
    git switch itinerary/activities
    git push -u origin
    ```
