    b. Next `git commit -m "added itinerary text file" `
    c. Then followed by `git push` the changes to his branch

    `git switch main`
    `git fetch`
    `git pull`
    `git switch itinerary/activities`
    `git merge main`
    `git switch main`
    `git merge itinerary/activities`
    `git push`
