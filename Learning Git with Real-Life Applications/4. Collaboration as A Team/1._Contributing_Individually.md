# Contribution Individually

## Pre-requisite
1. Have the repository setup

## Objective
1. Learn how to create a branch
2. Learn how to stage changes and commit
3. Learn how to update remote repository

## Storyline 1

1.  Developer A is tasked to come up with the itinerary for day 1.

    a. Firstly, he creates a branch name "`itinerary/activities`" with the following command

    ```
    git branch itinerary/activities
    ```

    ![Git create branch](../images/4_1/4_1_1.png)

2.  Followed by switching to the branch he created.

    - List all the branches in your local repository as well as remote branches

    ```
    git branch --all
    ```

    ![Git retrieve list of branches](../images/4_1/4_1_2.png)

    - Switch your current working branch to "itinerary/activities"

    ```
    git switch itinerary/activities
    ```

    ![Git switch to branch](../images/4_1/4_1_3.png)

3.  He started to edit the text file named `day1_itinerary.txt` and saved the file locally.

    - Following is the example written in the day1_itinerary.txt

    ```
    Day 1: Tokyo
    Morning: Visit the Meiji Shrine
        > A beautiful Shinto shrine located in the heart of Tokyo's bustling Shibuya district.
    Afternoon: Harajuku district
        >For shopping and people-watching.
        Takeshita Street
        >A colorful pedestrian shopping street full of shops and caf√©s.
    Evening: Watch the sunset from the top of the Tokyo Skytree, the tallest structure in Japan and one of the tallest towers in the world.
    ```

    `Added texts are as shown in the red box below`

4.  So in order to share the changes with the group, he has to "push" the updates into the remote repository. After he is done with editing of the text file, he staged, commit and push the files with the following commands:
    * a. Add all edited files and directories for the next commit 
    ```
    git add .
    ```
    * b. Creates a new commit with the changes you previously staged
    ```
    git commit -m "updated day 1 itinerary text file"
    ````
    * c. Push the local branch named '`itinerary/activities`' to the remote repository called '`origin`'
    ```
    git push --set-upstream-to origin itinerary/activities
    ````

    ![Git add ](../images/4_1/4_1_5.png)

5.  He then merge his branch to the main branch by checking for any changes in the main branch.
    * a. Switch your current branch to the "`master`" branch 
    ```
    git switch master
    ```
    * b. Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository & integrates them into your local branch ("`master`" in this case) 
    ```
    git pull
    ```
    * c. Switch your current branch "`master`" to "`itinerary/activities`"
    ```
    git switch itinerary/activities
    ```
    * d. Merge the changes from "`master`" branch into the current branch "`itinerary/activities`"
    ```
    git merge master
    ```
    * e. Switch your current branch back to "`master`" branch after merging the changes into "`itinerary/activities`"
    ```
    git switch master
    ```
    * f. Merge the changes from the "`itinerary/activities`" branch into the current branch "`master`"
    ```
    git merge itinerary/activities
    ```
    * g. Push the merged changes to the remote repository 
    ```
    git push
    ```

6.  Lastly, he switches back to his own branch and publish the branch along with his changes to the "`itinerary/activities`" remote repository.
    * a. Switch to "`itinerary/activities`" branch 
    ```
    git switch itinerary/activities
    ```
    * b. Push the current branch to the remote repository name '`origin`' and set it as the upstream branch
        * This allows you to use '`git push`' in the future without specifying the branch, simplifying the command to '`git push`'.
    ```
    git push -u origin
    ```
