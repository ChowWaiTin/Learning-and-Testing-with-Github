# Making a pull request

## Pre-requisite
1. Complete the previous tasks.

## Objective
1. Learn what is a pull request.
2. Learn how to perform a pull request.
3. Understand why pull request is used.

## Purpose of a Pull Request
1. Collaboration

    - Let others know about the changes pushed to a branch in a repository
    - Allow other collaborators to review any potential changes and make comments before the changes are merged into the main branch

## Storyline 5
1. After the different developers have performed their individual tasks in the respective branches, they decided to consolidate all of their work into a single final plan. However, they are worried that the previous issues that they have experienced when working with the repository will result in the final plan being incorrect. 

2. While searching for a solution, they found that it was possible to require a pull request before merger into the final `master` branch is allowed. The advantage of this is that they will be **able to review the changes made before the merger** and could settle any discrepancies.

3. Developer A plans to merge the "`itinerary/activities`" branch into the "`master`" branch. He starts of with changing his local branch to the `main` branch and ensure it is updated.

    - Switch branch with `git switch <branch_name>`

        ```
        git switch master
        ```

        ![Switch master branch](../images/4_5/4_5_git_switch_itinerary_to_master.png)

    - Update local `master` branch

        ```ps1
        # Fetch for changes
        git fetch origin
        # Pull changes
        git pull origin
        ```

        ![Switch master branch](../images/4_5/4_5_git_pull_devA_master.png)

4. Developer A switches to the "`itinerary/activities`" branch.

    - Checks the local branches `git branch`
        ```
        git branch -a
        ```
    - Switch branch with `git switch <branch_name>`
         ```
        git switch itinerary/activities
        ```

        ![Switch master branch](../images/4_5/4_5_git_switch_master_to_itinerary.png)

5. Developer A updates the "`itinerary/activities`" branch by merging the "`master`" branch into it

    - Merge `master` branch into `itinerary/activities` branch using `git merge <branch_to_merge>`

        ```
        git merge master
        ```

        If there are no updates to `master` since `itinerary/activities` was branched from it, it will indicate that the branch is already up to date.

6. Developer A updates the remote repository. 
    
    - Push to remote repository with `git push origin`

        ```
        git push origin
        ```

        If the local repository is up to date with the remote repository, there will be an indication that Everything up-to-date.
