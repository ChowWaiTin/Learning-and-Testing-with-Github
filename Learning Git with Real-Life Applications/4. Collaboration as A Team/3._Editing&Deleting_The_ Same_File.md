# Editing and Deleting File the Same File

## Pre-requisite
1. Complete the previous tasks.
2. Check that the files **day4_itinerary.txt** has been created in the initial file setup.

## Objective
1. Learn of possible merge conflict from deleting files
2. Handling of merge conflict

## Storyline 3 (Bao Jin)
1. Developer A and B continues to work on the itinerary. Both of them worked within the itinerary/activities branch. Developer A found a number of interesting activities and decided to add them to their day 4 plan in the **day4_itinerary.txt** file

    - Developer A checks the branches with `git branch -a`.
        ```
        git branch -a
        ```
        This will show all the branch (local and remote). The command is the same as the `git branch --all` used previously.
        
        Check that the current local branch is "`itinerary/activities`" branch. The asterisk(*) indicates the branch.
        
        ![git branch itinerary](../images/4_3/4_3_git_branch_all_itinerary_branch.png)

        If branch is missing, please ensure that the previous task has been completed.

    - If current branch is at "`master`", switch to the "`itinerary/activities`" branch.
        ```
        git switch itinerary/activities
        ```
        If switching from another branch:
        ![git branch master switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_switch_master_to_itinerary.png)
        
        If already on current branch:
        ![git branch itinerary switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_switch_itinerary_to_itinerary.png)

    - Developer A updates the branch using `git pull`
        ```
        git pull
        ```

        If there are no updates , the response will be `Already up to date`.

        ![git branch itinerary switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_pull_up_to_date.png)

        
    - Developer A added modifications to the **day4_itinerary.txt** and saved it.
        ```
        Day 4: Hakone
        Morning: Take the train from Kyoto to Hakone
            > A scenic area known for its hot springs and stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        Afternoon: Take a relaxing soak in one of the many hot springs (onsen) in the area.
            > Hakone is also known for its open-air museums, such as the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the Pola Museum of Art.
        Evening: Take a boat ride on Lake Ashi and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        ```
        ![git branch main](../images/4_3/4_3_day4_add_day_plan_devA.png)

2. Meanwhile, Developer B has learnt that the trip had to be cut short because of a change in their leave plan. Instead of the 4 days trip, the trip was cut short to 3 days. He decided to delete the the **day4_itinerary.txt** file. This change, however, was not made aware to Developer A.

    - Developer B checks the branches with `git branch -a`.
        ```
        git branch -a
        ```

        Check that the current local branch is "`itinerary/activities`" branch. The asterisk(*) indicates the branch.
        
        ![git branch itinerary](../images/4_3/4_3_git_branch_all_itinerary_branch.png)

    - If current branch is at "`master`", switch to the "`itinerary/activities`" branch
        ```
        git switch itinerary/activities
        ```
        If switching from another branch:
        ![git branch master switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_switch_master_to_itinerary.png)
        
        If already on current branch:
        ![git branch itinerary switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_switch_itinerary_to_itinerary.png)

    - Developer B updates the branch using `git pull`
        ```
        git pull
        ```

        If there are updates , the response will display the updating.

        ![git branch itinerary switch](../images/4_3/4_3_git_pull_with_updates.png)


3. After completing the update on the **day4_itinerary.txt** file, Developer A staged his changes, made a commit and pushed the changes to the remote repository.

    - Developer A stage changes with `git add .`
        ```
        git add .
        ```
    - Developer A commits with `git commit -m <comment>`
        ```
        git commit -m "Added new activities to activities.txt"
        ```
    - Developer A pull changes with `git pull origin`
        ```ps1
        # fetch the latest changes
        git fetch origin
        # pull latest changes from repository
        git pull origin
        ```
    - Developer A push changes with `git push origin`
        ```ps1
        # push the update
        git push origin
        ```

4. At the same time, Developer B deleted **day4_itinerary.txt** file. He staged his changes and made a commit. Before pushing his changes to the remote repository, he updated his local repository and found a conflict.

    - Developer B deletes the **day4_itinerary.txt**
        ![Dev B delete day 4 file](../images/4_3/4_3_devB_delete_day4_file.png)

        ![Day 4 file deleted](../images/4_3/4_3_day4_file_deleted.png)

    - Developer B stage changes with `git add .`
        ```
        git add .
        ```
    - Developer B commits with `git commit -m <comment>`
        ```
        git commit -m "Transfer activities info to itinerary.txt. Delete activities.txt."
        ```
    - Update local repository with remote repository with `git pull origin`
        ```ps1
        # fetch the latest changes
        git fetch origin
        # pull latest changes from repository
        git pull origin
        ```
    - Upon pulling the remote repository, Developer B encountered merge conflict from the deleted file.

5. Developer B subsequently proceeded to resolve the conflict

    - Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
    
    - Delete **day4_itinerary.txt**
    - Perform a commit with `git commit -m <comment>`
        ```
        git commit -m "Resolve conflict from deleted activities.txt"
        ```
6. Additionally, Developer B decided to transfer the new changes to the **day3_itinerary.txt**.

    - Added new changes to **day3_itinerary.txt**
        ```
        Day 3: Hakone
        Morning: Take the train from Kyoto to Hakone
            > A scenic area known for its hot springs and stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        Afternoon: Take a relaxing soak in one of the many hot springs (onsen) in the area.
            > Hakone is also known for its open-air museums, such as the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the Pola Museum of Art.
        Evening: Take a boat ride on Lake Ashi and enjoy the stunning views of Mount Fuji.
        ```

        ![Day 3 added changes](../images/4_3/4_3_day3_added_plan_from_day4_devB.png)

    - Stage changes and commit
        ```
        git add
        git commit -m "Copied deleted day
        ```

7. Developer B pushed his changes to the remote repository and proceed to inform Developer A of this change.
    
    - Developer B pushes the changes to remote repository with `git push`
        ```
        git push
        ```


## Lesson Learn
1. Potential conflicts from file deletion and how to handle it.

2. Importance of communication as a team.

3. Fetch and pull changes from remote repository before pushing changes.
