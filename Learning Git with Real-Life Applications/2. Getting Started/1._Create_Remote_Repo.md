# Initialise (Create) A Remote Repository on GitHub Webpage

## Purpose of A Remote Repository
* Collaboration:
    * Allows for Developers to work and contribute together on a project. Any changes made will be shared across the developers.
* Backup:
    * Serves as Virtual Backup Storage incase something happens to a Developer's Local Storage.
    *  E.g. If a developer's local repository is lost or damaged, they can clone the remote repository to get a new copy of the project.
* Easy Access:
    * Allows developers to Access the Project from Anywhere as long as there is an Available Internet Connection.
* Sharing:
    * Github provides a URL to the remote repository which allows for easy sharing and immediate start on the project.
* Integration with Services:
    * Many services integrate with Git remote repositories, such as continuous integration and deployment services. 
    * These services can automatically run tests or deploy code when changes are pushed to the remote repository.

## Steps to Creating a Remote Repository
1. Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/login)

    ![GitHub Login Page](../images/github_login.png)

2. Click on ![New Repository Button](../images/new_repo_btn.png) 

    ![GitHub Home Page](../images/github_home.png)

3. Create the Repository:
    * Entering a Name
    * Entering a Description (Optional)
    * Choose if the repository should be Public or Private
    * Add a README.md file (This is a Markdown file that provides a brief introduction or documentation about your project.)
    * Add a .gitignore file (This file contains a list of files and directories that Git should ignore when tracking changes. This is useful for preventing Git from tracking sensitive information, build artifacts, or temporary files.)
    * Choose a License (This file contains the license that applies to your project, which specifies how others can use, modify, and distribute your code.)
