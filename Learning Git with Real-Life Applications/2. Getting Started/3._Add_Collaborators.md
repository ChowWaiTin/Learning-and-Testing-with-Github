# Adding Collaborators (To Allow for Collaboration between Developers)

## Purpose of Adding Collaborators
*  To allow multiple people to contribute to the same codebase. 
*  Collaborators are other developers who have access to the repository and can make changes to its contents.

## Steps to Adding Collaborators
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on "Settings" at the top right of the page.
3. Click on "Collaborators" on the left-hand side of the page.
4. Under the "Manage Access" section, click the "Add people" button on the right-hand side of the page.
5. Enter the Username or Email Address of the Collaborator you want to add.
7. Click on "Add xxx to this repository" to send the invitation to the collaborator.
8. The collaborator will receive an email invitation to join the repository. Once they accepted the invitation, they will be added as a collaborator to the repository. 

## Alternative for Adding Collaborators
### Adding via Command Line Interface (CLI)
    
```
git remote add <collaborator_username> <remote https (or) ssh>
```
* To use the CLI to Add Collaborators:
    * Replace <collaborator_username> with the Git Username of your Collaborator
    * Replace <remote https (or) ssh> with URL of the Git Remote Repository on Github. (E.g. https://github.com/collaborator_username/repository.git)
