# Making Initial Commits (Initialise Initial Files) for Local Git Repository

## Purpose of making Initial Commits

While it's not strictly necessary to make an initial commit when initializing a local repository, it is generally a good practice to do so. Making an initial commit helps establish the initial state of your project and provides a starting point for tracking changes and collaborating with others.

Here are a few reasons why making an initial commit is beneficial:

* Establishing a baseline: 

    * The initial commit sets a baseline for your project, representing the initial version of your codebase. It helps mark the point at which your project begins and provides a reference for future changes and comparisons.

* Tracking project history: 

    * By making an initial commit, you start recording the history of your project. This history becomes valuable as your project evolves, enabling you to track changes, understand the progression of your code, and revert to previous versions if needed.

* Collaboration and sharing:  

    * If you plan to collaborate with others or push your code to a remote repository, having an initial commit is essential. It allows you to share your code with others and establish a common starting point for collaboration.

* Good version control practice:  

    * Making an initial commit aligns with good version control practices. It helps enforce a disciplined approach to tracking changes, maintaining a clean commit history, and organizing your work in logical units.

While the initial commit doesn't have to represent a fully functioning or complete project, it provides a meaningful starting point and helps you establish good habits for managing your codebase.

## Steps to Making Initial Commits with Best Practices
1. Start with a clean working directory: 

    * Before initializing the repository, make sure your working directory doesn't contain any unnecessary files that are unrelated to your project. It's best to begin with a clean slate.

2. [Initialise (Create) A Local Git Repository on Local Device](/Learning%20Git%20with%20Real-Life%20Applications/2.%20Getting%20Started/3._Create_Local_Repo.md) to help you track your project's changes.

3. Add your initial files to the folder:

    * E.g Files for Iternary Planning (Day 1 to 4)

3. Review and stage your files: 

    * Review the files in your project and determine which ones should be included in the initial commit
