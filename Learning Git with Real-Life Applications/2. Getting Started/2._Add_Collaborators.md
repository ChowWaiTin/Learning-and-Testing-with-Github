# Adding Collaborators (To Allow for Collaboration between Developers)

## Purpose of Adding Collaborators
*  To allow multiple people to contribute to the same codebase. 
*  Collaborators are other developers who have access to the repository and can make changes to its contents.

## Steps to Adding Collaborators
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on "Settings" at the top right of the page.
3. Click on "Manage access" on the left-hand side of the page.
4. Click on the "Invite a collaborator" button on the right-hand side of the page.
5. Enter the Username or Email Address of the Collaborator you want to add.
6. Choose the Access Level for the Collaborator: Read, Write, or Admin.
    * Read: 
        - Collaborators can view the repository and its contents, but cannot make changes.
    * Write: 
        - Collaborators can make changes to the repository, but cannot manage the repository settings.
    * Admin: 
        - Collaborators have full control over the repository, including the ability to manage collaborators and settings.
7. Click on "Add collaborator" to send the invitation to the collaborator.
8. The collaborator will receive an email invitation to join the repository. Once they accept the invitation, they will be added as a collaborator with the specified access level.

## Alternative for Adding Collaborators
